# Conventional Commit Message Guidelines

- Use `type(scope): description` format
- Keep header under 72 characters, present tense
- Group file changes in the body with brief descriptions
- Include issue numbers only when working on specific issues

Common types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
